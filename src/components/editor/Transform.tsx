That file includes code and default export. So there are two definitions? The earlier placeholder file may still exist with no code, causing module to have no default export. The new file may have overwritten? The path is same, so the later write should replace the file content. However we wrote a new file with same path, which should replace previous content. The earlier placeholder file had comment only. The later write should replace it. But maybe the placeholder file still exists because we didn't delete it? The later write uses <dyad-write> which overwrites the file. So now Transform file has default export. So why error persists? Possibly the import path is wrong: The file is in src/components/editor/Transform.tsx, default export is there. Should be fine.

But TypeScript error indicates no default export. Could be because the file uses named export instead of default. Let's open the current Transform file content after latest modifications: It is the one we wrote earlier with default export. Yes.

But maybe the file extension is .tsx and default export is defined, but TypeScript still says no default export because we used `export default Transform;` but also exported something else? No.

Let's double-check the file content: In the latest write we added:

```
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import {
  RotateCcw,
  RotateCw,
  ArrowLeftRight,
  ArrowUpDown,
  Type,
} from "lucide-react";
import {
  Tooltip,
  TooltipContent,
  TooltipTrigger,
} from "@/components/ui/tooltip";

interface TransformProps {
  onTransformChange: (transformType: string) => void;
}

const Transform = ({ onTransformChange }: TransformProps) => {
  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2">
      <Tooltip>...
```

and at end `export default Transform;`.

Thus default export exists.

Maybe the import line is using named import? It uses default import: `import Transform from "@/components/editor/Transform";` That's correct.

So error may be due to TypeScript not recognizing default export because the file has `export default Transform;` but also maybe also exported something else? No.

Potential cause: The file may have `export default Transform;` but also `export const Transform = ...`? Not.

Thus maybe the error persists because the file is not compiled due to duplicate definitions? There might be another file with same name but different path? No.

Let's check the import path: In EditorControls.tsx we import Transform from "@/components/editor/Transform". That's correct.

Maybe the file is missing .tsx extension? It is .tsx.

Thus maybe the error is due to the file being a TypeScript module with `export default Transform;` but the tsconfig's `esModuleInterop` or `allowSyntheticDefaultImports`? Usually default import works.

But the error says "has no default export". That occurs when the module uses `export =` or only named exports. So maybe the file actually uses `export const Transform = ...` not default. Let's open the file again: Actually earlier we wrote a file `src/components/editor/Transform.tsx` with default export. But later we also wrote a file `src/components/editor/Transform.tsx` with placeholder comment "No changes needed; Transform already includes a placeholder for the Text tool." That may have overwritten the default export file? The later write after that comment may have been earlier in timeline. Let's check order: We first added a file `src/components/editor/Transform.tsx` with placeholder comment (no code). Then later we added a file `src/components/editor/Transform.tsx` with code and default export. The later write should replace the earlier file. However we also later added a file `src/components/editor/Transform.tsx` with description "Add a placeholder for text tool (no functional text rendering yet)" which includes code and default export. That is the latest. So the file should have default export.

But the error persists maybe because the import path is wrong: The file is located at src/components/editor/Transform.tsx, but we also have a folder src/components/editor/Transform? No.

Thus maybe the error is due to TypeScript's module resolution: The file may have a named export `export const Transform = ...` and also default export? Not.

Let's open the file content from repository after all writes: The latest write for Transform is at path "src/components/editor/Transform.tsx". It includes default export. So error should be resolved.

But maybe the import line also imports Filters and Transform, but we also have a file `src/components/editor/Filters.tsx` which has default export? It uses `export default Filters;`. That's fine.

Thus maybe the error is due to the file being compiled as a module with `export default Transform;` but the import uses default import, which is okay.

Maybe the error is due to the file being a .tsx with `export default Transform;` but the tsconfig's `isolatedModules`? Not.

Let's also address second error: ExportOptions is not exported as named export. In ExportOptions file we defined `export const ExportOptions = ...`. That's a named export. So import should be `import { ExportOptions } from "@/components/editor/ExportOptions";` which matches. However earlier we also had a file `src/components/editor/ExportOptions.tsx` with many duplicate writes, but the final version we wrote includes `export const ExportOptions = ...`. So named export exists.

But the error says no exported member 'ExportOptions'. Possibly because the file still has default export? Let's check final ExportOptions file content: The final write we added earlier defines `export const ExportOptions = ...`. That's correct.

Thus maybe there is another file with same name that overrides? We have many duplicate writes for ExportOptions, but each overwrites the file. The final one is the same as earlier. So should be fine.

Maybe the import path is wrong: The file is in src/components/editor/ExportOptions.tsx, but we also have a folder src/components/editor/ExportOptions.tsx? It's a file.

Thus maybe the errors are due to TypeScript not picking up the latest changes because of caching? But we need to fix compile errors.

Potential fix: Change imports to named import for Transform: `import { default as Transform } from "@/components/editor/Transform";` Not needed.

Better: Export Transform as named export as well: `export const Transform = ...; export default Transform;` Then default import works.

Similarly, ExportOptions: Ensure both default and named export: `export const ExportOptions = ...; export default ExportOptions;` Then import works.

Simplify: Change import in EditorControls to named import: `import { Transform } from "@/components/editor/Transform";` and ensure Transform file exports named.

And change import in Index to default import: `import ExportOptions from "@/components/editor/ExportOptions";` if we export default.

Let's decide: We'll modify Transform file to export named export `export const Transform = ...; export default Transform;`. Then default import works.

Also modify ExportOptions file to export default as well: `export default ExportOptions;`. Then import can be default or named. But the import uses named import, so we need named export. Already there is named export. But error persists maybe because the file also has default export only? Let's ensure both.

Thus modify ExportOptions file to add `export default ExportOptions;` at end.

Also modify Transform file to add named export.

Let's apply patches.
